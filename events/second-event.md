The first **Jamstack Barcelona** after work virtual hangout! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

A friendly and informal virtual hangout to chat about the [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) and related web development topics such as: Headless CMS/Headless e-commerce, APIs, Static Site Generators, CDNs, Git, Vanilla JavaScript, CI/CD deployment techniques, and how we can use these tools to easily create fast and highly engaging web experiences.

Are you a web developer, designer, programmer or entrepreneur in and around the Barcelona area and interested in learning more about the Jamstack or perhaps sharing some of your knowledge with others? Maybe you're currently using Wordpress and you want a way to create websites more quickly that are faster and easier for you to maintain?

Itâ€™s a great opportunity for us to share methods, starter projects, tips and industry news. There will be chances to ask questions, share experiences and get to know other Jamstack users in Barcelona.

When: Tuesday 1st June, from 7pm to 8:30pm

How: Join the group Discord here: https://discord.gg/DsTVyuKy

We'll have video and text channels open, so join us and introduce yourself in whichever way you feel comfortable.

Hopefully see you soon, fellow Jamstacker!
